Autocorrelation-and-Heteroscedasticity-Detection-in-GDP-Investment-Model
This project analyzes the relationship between India‚Äôs economic growth (GDP) and investment levels (GCF) using real data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the years 1951‚Äì2007.


##  Step 1: Data Collection and Model Specification

This project begins by exploring the relationship between **India‚Äôs GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** and **Gross Capital Formation (GCF)** ‚Äî a key indicator of investment in the economy.
In simple terms, the goal was to understand whether higher investment levels are associated with higher national output over time.

###  Data Overview

* **Source:** Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ‚Äì official annual time-series data.
* **Period:** 1951 ‚Äì 2007
* **Variables Used:**

  * **GDP (Gross Domestic Product at Market Prices)** ‚Äì measures total economic output.
  * **GCF (Gross Capital Formation)** ‚Äì measures the total value of investments made in the economy.
* **Unit of Measurement:** Indian Rupees (INR crore)

Before running any model, the dataset was checked for:

* Missing or inconsistent values
* Outliers or extreme observations
* Overall trend patterns through **line charts** and **scatter plots**

##  Step 2 ‚Äî OLS Estimation & Interpretation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Model Framework

To represent the relationship, a simple linear regression model was used:

GDP_t = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ*GCF_t + Œµ_t

* **Œ≤‚ÇÄ** = Intercept ‚Äì base level of GDP when GCF = 0
* **Œ≤‚ÇÅ** = Slope ‚Äì average change in GDP for a one-unit change in GCF
* **Œµ** = Error term ‚Äì captures other macroeconomic factors not included in the model

### üßÆ Estimated Regression Equation

Using RBI time-series data (1951 ‚Äì 2008), the estimated equation was:

GDP_GCF = 293639.3+ 2.942763 GCF

**Key Results**

| Statistic              | Value  | Interpretation                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **R¬≤**                 | 0.9585 | GCF explains ~95.8 % of GDP variation                   |
| **Œ≤‚ÇÅ (p-value)**       | < 0.01 | Investment‚Äôs impact on GDP is statistically significant |
| **Durbin‚ÄìWatson (DW)** | 0.211  | Indicates strong positive autocorrelation in residuals  |

---
R¬≤ measures how much of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable.

###  Interpretation

* **Positive relationship:** Every ‚Çπ 1 crore increase in investment corresponds, on average, to a ‚Çπ 2.94 crore increase in GDP.
* **High R¬≤:** The model shows a strong fit, but time-series trends can inflate R¬≤; diagnostic testing is required to confirm reliability.
* **Autocorrelation detected:** A DW ‚âà 0.21 suggests residuals are positively correlated‚Äîviolating OLS independence assumptions. This issue was addressed later using **Cochrane‚ÄìOrcutt**, **Prais‚ÄìWinsten**, and **First-Difference** corrections.
